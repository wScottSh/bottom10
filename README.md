# Bottom 10 Typing

Bottom 10 Typing is a web-based typing tutor that focuses on improving your typing speed by targeting the words you struggle with the most. Instead of practicing large, uniform sets of words, it automatically identifies your "worst performing" words — the slowest words in your personal word set — and drills them in the next session. This approach helps you rapidly gain muscle memory efficiency where you need it most, accelerating your improvement.
