# Bottom 10 Typing

Typing improvement happens fastest when you focus on the words you type the slowest. Traditional typing tests and tutors cycle through large sets of words evenly, which can be inefficient. Bottom 10 Typing flips this around: after each test, it identifies your "worst performing" words — the slowest words in your personal word set — and drills them in the next session. Much like spaced repetition emphasizes the flashcards that give you the most trouble, or a Kanban board's limits highlight bottlenecks, Bottom 10 Typing makes inefficiencies unmistakably "loud," drawing your focus directly to them.
